supervised learing...
	machine learns under guided, learns of the feeding data with output in data. input and output is labeled....



unsupervised learing....
like we learn on ourself without guidance.

reinforcement learing....
agent learn on taking action and experience
learn on the bases of experience.
hit and trail method used to learn.

----------------------------------------

Problem type....
	1. Supervised
		1. Regression - continuous quintity (persion weight) don't need to label data into different class.
		2 classification (spam or not)

2. unsupervised -   
   1. Association ( relationship between bread and jamm , patterns in data)
	people who tend to by bread , and people who want to by jamm
   2. clustering ( buyers on the basis of their interest)  
       cluster the customer on the basis of their semilirities.

3. Reinforcement learning.....
  

-----------------------------------------------

Types of data.....
  1. labelled data in supervised data
  2. unlabelled data ( cluster on the basis of their semilarities)
  3. No predefined data ... 

--------------------------------------------------

Aim..
1. supervised - forcast outcomes
2. unsupervised - Discover underlying patterns.
3. Learn series of action

---------------------------------------------------
Approach....
1.supervised - Map labelled input to known output
2. Understand patterns and discover output
3. Follow trail and Error Method

---------------------------------------------------

Feedback...
1. supervised - Training
2. unsupervised - Explore patterns & trends
3. Reinforcement - Reward

--------------------------------------------------

use cases...
1. Study a bank credit dataset and make a decision about wheather to approve the load and applicaiton based on his profile.
   use.. KNN algorithm ( approve or not )
2. Mathematical equation for distance as a functuion fo speed so you can it to predict distance when only the speed of the ar is known 
 use . Linear Regression algorithm( predict the distance, when the speed of a car is given) continuous case

3.  to cluster a set of movies as either good or average based on their social media out reach
   k-Means algorithms ( popular movies ) (Not popular movie)

4.Peroform market basket analysis by finding association between items bought at a the grocery store
	use ( Association rule mining & apriori algorithem ) 
	perform market basket analysis

5. Place an agent in any on of the rooms(0,1,2,3,4,5) and the goal is to reach outside the building (room5)
	. Q-learing Algorithm ) Reinformation learing
